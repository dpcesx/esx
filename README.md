# ESX Docs

Instead of searching dev questions online, imagine coming here and reading a consensus of answers, perspectives, and discussions covering the topic thoroughly with necessary background, historical context, references, and resources.

What if ESX Docs maintained principles, recommended practices, and standards based on its collective knowledge?

What if ESX Docs stayed current with the latest developments in the JavaScript ecosystem and served as a single source of truth for developers to align and build better software.

What if ESX docs became the de facto standard, the second brain, the go-to-resource for developers learning and building projects?

Lets unite experienced and aspiring developers in the pursuit of a more unified JS community and build the future of software together.
